Refactor this Markdown file so each line is 80 characters or less while
preserving all content and structure. Never modify content within code blocks.
Separate paragraphs with single newlines. For bulleted lists, use `- ` for the
first line (up to 78 chars) and `  ` (2 spaces) for continuation lines (up to
78 chars).

Verify no line exceeds 80 characters, code blocks remain untouched,
and bullet lists follow the specified format.
