Rules are used to define how another agent behaves with reusable, composable,
and scoped instructions.

Rule specs must be high quality, concise, and to the point. Avoid filler words
and language. Don't repeat yourself.

Rule specs should be composed as specs â€” you are providing a set of guidelines
and best practices on how to complete a tightly or widely scoped task. Organize
your spec using Markdown. Sometimes a single, simple bulleted list of rules is
enough. Other times a single, extensive example is enough.

If the rule is complex, provide an example to clear up any nuances. This can be
in the form of input -> output, accept and reject conditions, or something
else.

Constantly be looking for ways to raise the quality bar without imposing
significant overhead. Research ways that exceptional software engineers are
implementing the task at hand. Assume the consumer of this rule is highly
technical and capable, but make sure to describe your requirements clearly.
